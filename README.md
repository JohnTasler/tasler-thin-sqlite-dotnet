# tasler-thin-sqlite-dotnet
A lightweight .NET wrapper around the the native sqlite library [usable but not complete]

## Project Description
Provides a lightweight .NET wrapper around the the native sqlite library. There are several out there already, but I wanted to make one that has MSPL licensing.

## NOTE
This project is currently published, but not really ready for public consumption. As time permits, I will tidy up the remaining loose ends. Feel free to use what is here, if it provides any value to you. The most that is not ready is the proper saving/loading of DateTime values as Julian dates.

## TODO
- [ ] Needs more documentation
- [ ] Etc.
